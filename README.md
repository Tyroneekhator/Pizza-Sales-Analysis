# Pizza-Sales-Analysis
## Table of contents
## Glossary
- KPI: Key Point Indicators are metrics that measure the business's success.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: The main purpose of EDA is to help look at data before making any assumptions. It can help identify obvious errors, as well as better understand patterns within the data, detect outliers or uncommon events, and find interesting relations among the variables.
- Revenue: the total amount of money generated by the business
## project overview
The project's objective is to help look at the trends in the dataset; followed by comparing which pizza type and size brings in the most sales and lastly looking at the best and worst sellers in the pizza dataset. Additionally, the data source is a CSV file but KPI questions are answered firstly with SQL then Excel with each metric for the pizzeria being visualized. Lastly, the insights from the analysis will be explained with recommendations given.

## Columns in the dataset
- Pizza_id: the unique identifier of each pizza ordered.
- Order_id: the distinct code of each order made by a customer.
- Total_orders: the column that allows one to get the total orders from the data set

## Tools Used
- SQL: Structured Query Language is a domain-specific language used to manage data, especially in a relational database management system. It is beneficial in handling structured data, i.e., data incorporating relations among entities and variables
- Excel: A spreadsheet software
## Data cleaning and transformation process
### Data SQL Process
1. CSV file which shall be put in SQL Server Management Studio
2. Create a new database
3. Import flat file
4. Change data types
   - nvarchar(50) ---> varchar(50)
   - pizza_ingredients nvarchar(50)  ---> varchar(200)
   - pizza_id small init to init
   - Order_id small init to init
### Data cleaning in Excel
1. Change column values
     - S - Small
     - M - Medium
     - L - Large
     - XL - Extra large
     - XXL - Extra Extra Large
  - Method uses the IFS statement function in the helper column
  - Copy and paste values in the original column then delete the helper column.
## Key point indicators requirements in SQL and Excel
These are the questions that need to be answered to measure the success rate of the business.
1. Total revenue: The sum of the total price of all pizza orders.
2. Average Order Value: the average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders
3. Total pizzas sold: The sum of the quantities sold.
4. Total orders: The total number of orders placed.
5. Average pizzas per order: The average number of pizzas sold per order, is calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.
6. Total number of orders placed by days of the week.
7. Hourly trend for numbers of pizzas ordered.
8. Percentage of sales by pizza category.
9. Percentage of sales by pizza size.
10. Total pizzas sold by pizza category.
11. Top 5 best sellers by total pizzas sold.
12. Top 5 worst sellers by total pizzas sold.
